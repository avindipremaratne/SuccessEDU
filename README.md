Scenario

Students face difficulties when submitting assignments in because sometimes, they need to submit them during week days. This system allows the students to log in to the system and be able to see submitted and pending assignments with deadlines. In addition this system facilitates authentication levels (ex: Admin levels and user levels), backend functionality (data base) and Course searching.
